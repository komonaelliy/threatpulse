It\u2019s staying motivated through the long PDFs, the repetitive labs, and the feeling of studying alone.</p> <p>We wanted to take some of that pain away and make learning networking feel more structured, more guided, and more rewarding. So we started building something based on short lessons, clear diagrams, and a gamification system that helps you actually feel your improvement.</p> <p>The idea is to help learners stay consistent, avoid feeling lost, and have a more enjoyable path through the CCNA topics.</p> <p>We\u2019re currently sharing this with CCNA learners and mentors to see if it actually helps, and we\u2019d definitely welcome any feedback or questions :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sorry_Flatworm_521\"> /u/Sorry_Flatworm_521 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://pingmynetwork.com/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1oyrn4t/trying_to_make_ccna_learning_more_engaging_for/\">[comments]</a></span>",
